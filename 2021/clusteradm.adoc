A few Project milestones kept the cluster administration team busy in 2021.  First, in April a new major version was released, FreeBSD 13.0.  This was the first release to include tier 1 support for 64-bit ARM.  New aarch64 machines were added to the cluster, including reference machines for FreeBSD versions 12, 13, and 14 and a freebsd-update builder for the security officer.  Second, the conversion from Subversion to Git, which started in 2020 and continued into 2021, kept the team busy.  Tools and infrastructure had to be updated or created to support Git.  Some examples include cluster management scripts, new Git mirrors, and a cgit web interface to provide a similar web service as svnweb.  A third Project milestone that involved the team was the conversion of the Project's documentation from DocBook to AsciiDoc.  Cluster Administration's main role for the documentation conversion was to update https://www.freebsd.org and https://docs.freebsd.org.  A fourth and final milestone the Cluster Administration team was involved with was the conversion of the Project's mailing lists from mailman to mlmmj.

Aside from work related to these milestones, the team provides and maintains resources that are easy to take for granted.  For example, with 150 physical machines and 400 jails in the cluster, staying on top of hardware updates and failures is a regular task.  Disks need replacing, software needs fixing and updating,  networking issues need to be corrected, and backup plans need to be maintained in case of disaster.  New servers to keep up with demand need to be added to the cluster.  New Brazilian mirrors, three powerpc machines, a new Phabricator server, a new CGI backend server, and a new cluster site in Japan were all added to the cluster in 2021.  The new mirrors in Brazil and Japan were the result of generous donations from Nic.br and Broadband Tower.

The FreeBSD Foundation contributes to Cluster Administration by allocating financial resources for hardware purchases.  Here are some of the hardware purchase the Foundation made since 2020 to support the Cluster Administration team and the Project:

- SSD backed pkg and Git mirror for US east coast
- new servers to run the cgit web interface
- web server to host web sites (www, docs, cgi, and ftp-sync)
- new web servers to run the FreeBSD Bugzilla instance and the wiki [1]
- new web server to hosts reviews.freebsd.org and some other web services
- new server to host the Git repository
- two new servers for expruns [2]
- new FTP and pkg mirror for Malaysia
- four new Ampere eMAG pkg builders for arm64 packages
- reference servers [3]
- new server to build freebsd-update for arm64.

The Foundation also supports the cluster administration with human resources.  Li-Wen Hsu, a full-time employee of the Foundation, is an active member of the Cluster Administration Team.
